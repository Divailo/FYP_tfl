# Stuff to do

- For phase in stage keep in mind that all the non-specified signal groups should show red by assumption

- Make a base case so I don't crawl the file forever -> while line != None: ne6ta

- Read from plan array, so you know when stages switch

- Edit plan array depending on the PDDL result

- Think of way to exit the program safely (No license for Vissim, Vissim not installed, etc)

- Ask Michael about interstages?

- Max green time???
